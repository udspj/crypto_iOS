# web3swift
- Swift implementation of [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) functionality :zap:
- Interaction with remote node via JSON RPC :thought_balloon:
- Smart-contract ABI parsing :book:
- ABI deconding (V2 is supported with return of structures from public functions. Part of 0.4.22 Solidity compiler)
- RLP encoding
- Interactions (read/write to Smart contracts) :arrows_counterclockwise:
- Local keystore management (geth compatible)
- Literally following the standards:
-  [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) HD Wallets: Deterministic Wallet
-  [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) (Seed phrases)
-  [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) (Key generation prefixes)
-  [EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md) (Replay attacks protection) *_enforced!_*


## Requirements
Web3swift requires Swift 4.2 and deploys to `macOS 10.10`, `iOS 9`, `watchOS 2` and `tvOS 9` and `linux`.

Don't forget to set the iOS version in a Podfile, otherwise you get an error if the deployment target is less than the latest SDK.

## Installation

- **Swift Package Manager:**
  Although the Package Manager is still in its infancy, web3swift provides full support for it.
  Add this to the dependency section of your `Package.swift` manifest:

    ```Swift
    .package(url: "https://github.com/BANKEX/web3swift.git", from: "2.0.0")
    ```

- **CocoaPods:** Put this in your `Podfile`:

    ```Ruby
    pod 'web3swift', :git => 'https://github.com/bankex/web3swift.git'
    ```

- **Carthage:** Put this in your `Cartfile`:

    ```
    github "BANKEX/web3swift" ~> 2.0
    ```


## Check this out
- Private key and transaction were created directly on an iOS device and sent directly to [Infura](https://infura.io) node
- Native API
- Security (as cool as a hard wallet! Right out-of-the-box! :box: )
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Possibility to work with all existing smart contracts
- Referencing the newest features introduced in Solidity

## Design decisions
- Not every JSON RPC function is exposed yet, priority is given to the ones required for mobile devices
- Functionality was focused on serializing and signing transactions locally on the device to send raw transactions to Ethereum network
- Requirements for password input on every transaction are indeed a design decision. Interface designers can save user passwords with the user's consent
- Public function for private key export is exposed for user convenience, but marked as UNSAFE_ :) Normal workflow takes care of EIP155 compatibility and proper clearing of private key data from memory

## Usage

Here's a few use cases of our library

### Initializing Ethereum address

```bash
let coldWalletAddress: Address = "0x6394b37Cf80A7358b38068f0CA4760ad49983a1B"
let constractAddress: Address = "0x45245bc59219eeaaf6cd3f382e078a461ff9de7b"
```
Ethereum addresses are checksum checked if they are not lowercased and always length checked

### Setting options

```bash
var options = Web3Options.default
// public var to: Address? = nil - to what address transaction is aimed
// public var from: Address? = nil - form what address it should be sent (either signed locally or on the node)
// public var gasLimit: BigUInt? = BigUInt(90000) - default gas limit
// public var gasPrice: BigUInt? = BigUInt(5000000000) - default gas price, quite small
// public var value: BigUInt? = BigUInt(0) - amount of WEI sent along the transaction
options.gasPrice = gasPrice
options.gasLimit = gasLimit
options.from = "0xE6877A4d8806e9A9F12eB2e8561EA6c1db19978d"
```

### Getting ETH balance

```bash
let address: Address = "0xE6877A4d8806e9A9F12eB2e8561EA6c1db19978d"
let web3Main = Web3(infura: .mainnet)
let balance: BigUInt = try web3Main.eth.getBalance(address)
```

### Getting gas price

```bash
let web3Main = Web3(infura: .mainnet)
let gasPrice: BigUInt = try web3Main.eth.getGasPrice()
```

### Getting ERC20 token balance

```bash
let contractAddress: Address = "0x45245bc59219eeaaf6cd3f382e078a461ff9de7b" // BKX token on Ethereum mainnet
let balance = try ERC20(contractAddress).balance(of: "0x6394b37Cf80A7358b38068f0CA4760ad49983a1B")
print("BKX token balance = " + String(bal))
```



### Sending ETH

```bash
let mnemonics = Mnemonics()
let keystore = try BIP32Keystore(mnemonics: mnemonics)
let keystoreManager = KeystoreManager([keystore])
let web3Rinkeby = Web3(infura: .rinkeby)
web3Rinkeby.addKeystoreManager(keystoreManager) // attach a keystore if you want to sign locally. Otherwise unsigned request will be sent to remote node
var options = Web3Options.default
options.from = keystore.addresses.first! // specify from what address you want to send it
let intermediateSend = try web3Rinkeby.contract(Web3Utils.coldWalletABI, at: coldWalletAddress).method(options: options) // an address with a private key attached in not different from any other address, just has very simple ABI
let sendResultBip32 = try intermediateSend.send(password: "BANKEXFOUNDATION")
```



### Sending ERC20

```bash
let web3 = Web3(infura: .rinkeby)
let erc20 = ERC20("0xa407dd0cbc9f9d20cdbd557686625e586c85b20a", from: yourAddress)
let result = try erc20.transfer(to: "0x6394b37Cf80A7358b38068f0CA4760ad49983a1B", amount: NaturalUnits("0.0001"))
}
```
